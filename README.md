# Neovim MCP Server

Connect Claude Desktop (or any Model Context Protocol client) to Neovim using MCP and the official neovim/node-client JavaScript library. This server leverages Vim's native text editing commands and workflows, which Claude already understands, to create a lightweight code or general purpose AI text assistance layer.

**Version 0.5.3** - Now with a DXT package!

## Features

- Connects to your nvim instance if you expose a socket file, for example `--listen /tmp/nvim`, when starting nvim
- Views your current buffers and manages buffer switching
- Gets cursor location, mode, file name, marks, registers, and visual selections
- Runs vim commands and optionally shell commands through vim
- Can make edits using insert, replace, or replaceAll modes
- Search and replace functionality with regex support
- Project-wide grep search with quickfix integration
- Comprehensive window management
- Health monitoring and connection diagnostics

## API

Using this comprehensive set of **19 tools**, Claude can peer into your neovim session, navigate buffers, perform searches, make edits, record macros, manage tabs and folds, and handle your complete development workflow with standard Neovim features.

### Prompts

- **neovim_workflow**: Get contextual help and guidance for common Neovim workflows including editing, navigation, search, buffer management, window operations, and macro usage. Provides step-by-step instructions for accomplishing tasks with the available MCP tools.

## Error Handling

The server implements comprehensive error handling with custom error classes and consistent error responses:

- **NeovimConnectionError**: Socket connection failures with detailed messages
- **NeovimCommandError**: Command execution failures with command context  
- **NeovimValidationError**: Input validation failures

**New in v0.5.2**: All tools now include robust try-catch error handling that returns meaningful error messages in proper MCP format. Features include connection health monitoring, graceful error propagation, and actionable error messages to help diagnose issues.

## Limitations

- May not interact well with complex neovim configurations or plugins
- Shell command execution is disabled by default for security
- Socket connection required - won't work with standard vim

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `ALLOW_SHELL_COMMANDS`: Set to 'true' to enable shell command execution (e.g. `!ls`). Defaults to false for security.
- `NVIM_SOCKET_PATH`: Set to the path of your Neovim socket. Defaults to '/tmp/nvim' if not specified.

## Installation

### Option 1: DXT Package (Recommended)
1. Download the latest `.dxt` file from [Releases](https://github.com/bigcodegen/mcp-neovim-server/releases)
2. Drag the file to Claude Desktop

### Option 2: Manual Installation
Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MCP Neovim Server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-neovim-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ALLOW_SHELL_COMMANDS": "true",
        "NVIM_SOCKET_PATH": "/tmp/nvim"
      }
    }
